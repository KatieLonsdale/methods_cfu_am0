# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel pretty confident. I was having a little trouble understanding the more complicated methods when looking through new ones. I think they will make more sense to me as I learn more about and gain more experience with Ruby.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel very confident writing my own simple methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
When you make your own method, can you use it anywhere in the file? What about in other files?
